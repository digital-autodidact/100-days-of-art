# Rules of my #100DaysOfArt Challenge

## Main Commitment
### *I will draw for at least an hour every day for the next 100 days.*

### Start Date: January 7, 2025

## My Plan for the Challenge
1. I will code for at least 1 hour every day for the next 100 days*
2. I will post about my progress every day on my [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/autodidactdiary/) account
3. I will update the [log.md](log.md) file in this repo with the day's progress and provide a commit link so that others can check my progress
4. I will push a commit to this repo every day
5. I will work through Jason Brubaker's [Cognitive Drawing workbook](https://www.amazon.com/Cognitive-Drawing-Learn-Female-Figure/dp/1734879912)
6. I will encourage at least two other people in the same challenge on Twitter every day

*NOTE: I will not count the hours spent in MAP classes or in college classes


## General Practice Plan

- 5 minute warmup (do a quick continuous line contour drawing of a random object)
- 20 minute [gesture drawing video](https://www.youtube.com/@GESDRAWPARTY)
- 5 minute break
- 20 minute working on a page from the Cognitive Drawing workbook
- 10 minute post-practice review


### Post-Practice Review Questions

1. What do you like and dislike about your sketches today?
2. Did you make any mistakes today? If so, are there any lessons you can derive from them?
3. What did you learn from your practice session today? Is there anything you want to do more drills on?
4. Did you use any tutorial resources apart from the Cognitive Drawing workbook or the GES DRAW PARTY channel?



## The Ultimate Goal
Invent a character design for Misty Rockwell, an original character I invented for a storyverse I'm cultivating


## Twitter hashtags to use:
#100DaysOfArt
#cognitivedrawing
#learninpublic
#figuredrawing
#gesdrawparty


## Ideas for Improving How I Chronicle My Quest

- Setup an IFTTT workflow between Instagram and Twitter

You could set up your Instagram in such a way that every post you make will be posted on Twitter automatically. The easiest way to do that is to create a [IFTTT workflow](https://ifttt.com/applets/aVxGRrtD-tweet-your-instagrams-as-native-photos-on-twitter).

- Record yourself while drawing with your smartphone (or Canon camera)

If you record yourself, you can upload a short clip to Twitter! Just keep in mind, you can only upload a 140 second clip, and it can only be 512MB max!

- Use the [100 Day Goal Journal](https://www.amazon.com/100-Day-Goal-Journal-Accomplish-Matters/dp/1454930748) 

In contrast to the [log.md](log.md), whose purpose is to share news about your progress, this journal is better suited for planning and reviewing your daily actions related to this challenge.

- Do your post-practice ritual as a video diary entry

If writing it down is too burdensome, you can record yourself using your webcam and do the review that way.
