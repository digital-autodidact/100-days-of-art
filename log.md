# #100DaysOfArt Log


<h2 align="center"> Day 1: Wednesday, February 5, 2025</h2>

### **Today's Progress**: 
*I started my #100DaysOfArt challenge today. Here's what I did:*
- *Completed Day 1 exercise of the Cognitive Drawing workbook*


### **Thoughts & Feelings**: 

*I feel glad that I started! My enthusiam is high, although I do sense a small amount of nervousness. Will I be able to sustain the habit behavior throughout the challenge?*

*Only time will tell, I suppose. For now, I will continue one more day. That's what I'm going to keep telling myself — one more day.*


### **Post-Practice Review**:
**1. What was your main goal for this session? Did you achieve it?**

*Today, simply starting was the goal. Success!*


**2. What do you like and dislike about your sketches today?**

*I feel proud when I glance at my sketches. I can see small improvements in the sketches I drew in boxes 1 to 5.*

**3. Did you make any mistakes today? If so, are there any lessons you can derive from them?**

*Hmm, I'm hesitant to call them a "mistake," but I did notice myself struggling with these three sections of the eye:*
- *The arch of the eyebrow*
- *The creases beneath the lower eyelid*
- *The eye lashes on the right side of the eye*


**4. What did you learn from your practice session today? Is there anything you want to do more drills on?**

*I feel that the best way I can correct my performance here is to simply put in more reps. The "mistakes I made today are merely because drawing an eye is an unfamiliar skill to me.*

**5. Did you use any tutorial resources apart from the Cognitive Drawing workbook?**

*Out of curiosity, I googled "testing effect". I know that the Cognitive Workbook is based on this learning principle, so I figured it'd be wise to learn more about it. To satisfy my curiousity, I read these articles:*

<h2 align="center"> Day 2: Thursday, February 6, 2025</h2>

### **Today's Progress**: 

*I completed day 2 of the challenge! Here's what I did today:*

- *Attended an ink-and-pen drawing class*
- *Completed a contour sketch.*

### **Thoughts & Feelings**: 

*I deviated from my initial plan of drawing in the Cognitive Drawing workbook today because I knew I would attend a two-hour drawing class today. I made this judgement call because I don't think I have the mental endurance yet to do both the class and then another 30 minute drawing class.*

*Oddly, I feel a bit guilty for this deviation, even though logically I feel that I shouldn't — after all, I drew! The spirit of the challenge is for me to draw a little every day. I shall try not to dwell on the deviation and instead I'll celebrate and praise myself for continuing forward. Well done, Anthony!*


### **Post-Practice Review**:
**1. What was your main goal for this session? Did you achieve it?**

*Today, the goal was to simply show up again and draw. I did that, so success!*

**2. What do you like and dislike about your sketches today?**

*Let's start with what I like:*
- *The overall likeness I drew was close! You can easily recognize my sketch is similar to the reference sketch*
- *I feel I did a good job at copying over the lines that make up the pants of the figure*

*Things I dislike:*
- *Oof, those hands! I do not like how I drew the hands on the figure in my sketch. It's pretty glaring*
- *The left arm is distorted in my sketch when compared to the original*
- *My sketch is missing details in the head*


**3. Did you make any mistakes today? If so, are there any lessons you can derive from them?**

*Yes I did. As mentioned above, I erred when copying over the left arm. There is also a mismatch in the head and in the necktie.*

*If there's something I can learn here, I think it would be to give myself permission to make mistakes — many, many mistakes. It's important for me to remember that if I'm unwilling to make mistakes, that's the same as saying I'm not willing to learn. Making mistakes is a fundamental part of my learning process!*


**4. What did you learn from your practice session today? Is there anything you want to do more drills on?**

*I feel that it's necessary for me to keep training my observation skill. Today's exercise was uncomfortable, but good for me. Why? It challenged me to inspect the target — the drawing reference — closely, and in novel way.*

*When the teacher gave us the reference image, she instructed us to turn it upside down and then try to sketch. Why? The instructor stated that the human brain has two ways of looking at a thing:*

1. *Conceptual seeing*
2. *Perceptual observation*

*The point of today's sketching exercise is to train us to step out of using mode 1 and to try using mode 2. The easiest way to do that? Turn a reference drawing upside down!*

**5. Did you use any tutorial resources apart from the Cognitive Drawing workbook?**

*Yes I did! I googled "upside down sketches" to try to figure out why the teacher recommended we draw images upside down. Initially, it struck me as a strange exercise and I wanted to what was the point of doing it. I found a worthy answer in this article:*
