# #100DaysOfArt Log


<h2 align="center"> Day 1: Wednesday, February 5, 2025</h2>

### **Today's Progress**: 
*I started my #100DaysOfArt challenge today. Here's what I did:*
- *Completed Day 1 exercise of the Cognitive Drawing workbook*


### **Thoughts & Feelings**: 

*I feel glad that I started! My enthusiam is high, although I do sense a small amount of nervousness. Will I be able to sustain the habit behavior throughout the challenge?*

*Only time will tell, I suppose. For now, I will continue one more day. That's what I'm going to keep telling myself â€” one more day.*


### **Post-Practice Review**:
**1. What was your main goal for this session? Did you achieve it?**

*Today, simply starting was the goal. Success!*


**2. What do you like and dislike about your sketches today?**

*I feel proud when I glance at my sketches. I can see small improvements in the sketches I drew in boxes 1 to 5.*

**3. Did you make any mistakes today? If so, are there any lessons you can derive from them?**

*Hmm, I'm hesitant to call them a "mistake," but I did notice myself struggling with these three sections of the eye:*
- *The arch of the eyebrow*
- *The creases beneath the lower eyelid*
- *The eye lashes on the right side of the eye*


**4. What did you learn from your practice session today? Is there anything you want to do more drills on?**

*I feel that the best way I can correct my performance here is to simply put in more reps. The "mistakes I made today are merely because drawing an eye is an unfamiliar skill to me.*

**5. Did you use any tutorial resources apart from the Cognitive Drawing workbook?**

Out of curiosity, I googled "testing effect". I know that the Cognitive Workbook is based on this learning principle, so I figured it'd be wise to learn more about it. To satisfy my curiousity, I read these articles:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testing_effect
