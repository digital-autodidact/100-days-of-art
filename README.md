# Anthony's #100DaysOfArt Challenge

*Hello curious visitor, welcome to my repo!*

In this README, you'll learn more about who I am, what I like to do, and why I do it. In doing so, I hope what you read resonates with you, so that one day we might collaborate and maybe even become friends!


## Who Am I?

*Hi, I'm Anthony! I'm committing myself to complete the #100DaysOfCode challenge.*

I'm a guy that likes to introduce himself as **"the Digital Autodidact"**! Why is that, you ask? Because I have an insatiable curiosity! I like to teach myself new skills for fun, and make stories about it online. What's the point of living, if not to be curious about the world and maybe learn something useful before our time on earth is up? Let's learn something together today 😄

Ultimately, my dream is to be **a Renaissance Man of the 21st century**! I intend to spend the rest of my life taking risks, learning from my mistakes, and building projects related to the subjects that fascinate my curiosity.


## What's this repo about?

*This repo is where I'll chronicle my quest to become a better portraiture artist by completing the #100DaysOfArt challenge!*

My overall intention for the challenge to become a better portraiture artist who diligently sketches every day. Here are the things I want to accomplish:
- how to draw the human figure
- Develop a positive reputation online as "the Digital Autodidact"
- Complete Jason Brubaker's Cognitive Drawing workbook (the female figure edition)
- Invent a character design for Misty Rockwell, an original character I invented for a storyverse I'm cultivating






## Why am I doing this?

### (1) To promote autodidactism

> *"The mind is a beautiful thing to invest in and a terrible thing to waste"*

> *"I am always ready to learn, although I do not always like being taught"*

> *"To live in this world without curiosity is like wandering a great library without touching its books"*

Autodidactism is the practice of self-education. If you like etymology, the name has two parts: “auto”, meaning self, and “didactic”, which relates to teaching or instruction.

Put simply, autodidactism is when you learn a subject or skill independently, usually outside of formal learning institutions (such as K-12 education, or university). The key thing is not whether or not you learn in a classroom, but rather having the "autodidact mindset". If you have the autodidactic mindset, you don't limit your learning to inside a classroom nor do you cling to one teacher. You're a self-directing learner: You take the initiative, setting your own curriculum, your own learning goals and organizing your deliberate practice periods. 

You put in plenty of hours studying alone, expanding your knowledge and skills beyond any structured curriculum offered at a university. You keep going for months and years, not for the sake of a credential, but because you're insatiably curious. Like me 😉


### (2) To Become a Competent Artist

> *"Knowledge applied is power; happiness is the feeling of power increasing"*

I aspire to be an individual who has the optimism, competency and confidence to actively shape the world — a playful creator, so to speak. I wish to shape the world as I envision it instead of passively letting the world shape me.

Learning how to draw is merely one aspect of my commitmment to learning useful skills.

The antidote to feelings of powerlessness I feel is to increase the amount of skills at my disposal. As I increase the amount of skills I have, I increase my power to have an effect on the world. And that potency feels good. Really good.


### (3) To promote myself as the Digital Autodidact

> *"I shall note be satisfied that I have done my best until my name is known from one end of the world to the other"*

I relish positive attention! I'll be the first to acknowledge that I feel delight whenever people recognize I'm passionate about being autodidactic and when they resonate with my level of curiosity.

I promote the fact that I'm a digital autodidact so that other people — especially those who share the same qualities as I do — can easily find me. I want to find the company of kindred spirits, because through experience, I know that my quest to become a Renaissance man can be a lonely path to walk sometimes.

Many people nowadays don't see the point in exerting oneself to self-improve, especially in a culture that values convenience and comfort. I don't relate well to the mainstream culture I live in because I subscribe to different ideals. I say this, not to look down upon anyone else, but merely to acknowledge that there's a difference — and that this difference is frequently what creates the aforementioned feelings of loneliness.

Whenever I share things online, it is to be a beacon — a rally point for all who wish to share in the insatiable curiosity and wonder I feel. In the end, I'm just a guy who likes to learn things and who wants to play with others. That's all 😊


### (4) To promote the Strenuous Life Philosophy

> *"I wish to preach, not the doctrine of ignoble ease, but the doctrine of the strenuous life, the life of toil and effort, of labor and strife; to preach that highest form of success which comes, not to the man who desires mere easy peace, but to the man who does not shrink from danger, from hardship, or from bitter toil, and who out of these wins the splendid ultimate triumph."*

> *"A mere life of ease is not in the end a very satisfactory life, and, above all, it is a life which ultimately unfits those who follow it for serious work in the world."*

If there's one philosophy I firmly stand for, it would be Theodore Roosevelt's "Strenuous Life" philosophy. I believe there is something special and good in a man who voluntarily chooses to live a strenuous life, particularly in today's sendentary world. 

This ideal is beautifully illustrated in Xenophon's allegory, ["The Choice of Hercules"](https://www.artofmanliness.com/character/manly-lessons/manvotional-the-choice-of-hercules/). Its main lesson is powerfully summed up here in two statements:

> *"There can be no sweet without the bitter. No growth and no true happiness is obtainable without effort and without developing virtue"*

> *"Unearned comfort knows no nobility. Fat, drunk and stupid is no way to go through life; to live so is to hoard up anguish, torment and remorse to be suffered later"*


There is nothing praiseworthy in being a man who allows himself to deteriorate simply because he wishes to avoid discomfort at all costs. Conversely, there is something admirable in exerting oneself — while still taking proper self-care — in the pursue of a grand mission.

What that grand mission will vary person to person, but the point still stands true.

My mission is **to champion the Strenuous Life in the 21st century**. How? Through continuous self-improvement, and by becoming a powerful Renaissance man who is a competent programmer, artist and storyteller. Though deed and word, I will demonstrate the worthiness of the TSL philosophy to all. I'm probably not going to be liked by everyone, but that's okay — I only wish to find my kind of people, wherever they are on Earth. Popularity isn't the goal; building a cadre of autodidacts is the goal!
